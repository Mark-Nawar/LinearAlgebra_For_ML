## machine learning is great for :
- problems for which exisitng solutions require a lot of fine tuning or long list of rules.
- complex problems for which using traditional approach yields no good solution.
- a typical fluctuatuing environment where a learing algorithm can adapt to new data.
- getting insights about a complex problem and a large amount of data.

## types of learning systems and how to classify them:
- whether or not the system needs a human supervison ( supervised , unsupervised ,semisupervised , reinforcement learning)
- whether or not the system can learn incrimentally on the fly ( online vs bach learing )
- work by comparing new data points to old ones or work on detecting the patterns in the data and then build a predictive model ( instance based vs model based learning)

## supervised learning most popular algorithms:
- KNN
- Linear / logistic regression 
- Support vector machines
- Decision tree and random forests
- Neural Networks

## unsupervised learning most popular techniques:
- Clutering:
   <ol>
            <li>K means
            <li>DBSCAN
            <li>HCA
   </ol>
- Anomaly detection and novelty detection:
   <ol>
     <li>One class SVM
     <li> isolation forest
  </ol>
  
- Visualization and dimensionality reduction:
  <ol>
   <li> PCA ( principal component analysis) 
   <li> Kernel PCA
   <li> Locally linear embedding ( LLE ) 
   <li> T-SNE
  </ol>
- Association rule learning:
  <ol>
    <li>Apriori Algorithm
    <li>Eclat
  </ol>
  
## Main challenges of machine learning:

- the insufficient amount of data
- Data that are nonrepresentative
- Poor quality data ( ex outliers and noise )
- irrelevant features
- Overfitting / Underfitting
